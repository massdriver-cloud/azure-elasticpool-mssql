# azure-elasticpool-mssql

Azure SQL Database elastic pools are a simple, cost-effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable usage demands. The databases in an elastic pool are on a single server and share a set number of resources at a set price. Elastic pools in SQL Database enable software as a service (SaaS) developers to optimize the price performance for a group of databases within a prescribed budget while delivering performance elasticity for each database.

## Use Cases
### Share resources for multiple databases
Elastic pools enable you to purchase resources for a pool shared by multiple databases to accommodate unpredictable periods of usage by individual databases. You can configure resources for the pool based either on the DTU-based purchasing model or the vCore-based purchasing model. The resource requirement for a pool is determined by the aggregate utilization of its databases.
### Flexible purchasing models
Azure SQL Database elastic pools support two purchasing models: the DTU-based purchasing model and the vCore-based purchasing model.
* The DTU-based purchasing model is based on a bundled measure of compute, storage, and IO resources
* The vCore-based purchasing model is based on a virtual core metric that provides flexibility for specifying the compute and storage requirements for an individual database in the pool

## Design
### Virtual network integration
Several networking resources are provisioned in order for your SQL server to be available to other resources in your Azure virtual network. A subnet is created and delegated to your SQL server for exclusive use, and a firewall rule is created to allow traffic from within the virtual network.

## Features
### Auto CIDR
The Masssdriver Auto CIDR feature takes the burden of selecting a CIDR range away from you by determining the next available CIDR range and automatically provisions it. You still have the option to manually set your CIDR range if you prefer.

## Best Practices
### Dedicated Subnet
A dedicated virtual network subnet is provisioned for VNet integration
### Backups and Redundancy
The SQL server service automatically creates database backups and stores them within the region.

## Security
### Auto-generated password
A random 16 character password will be generated for your server.
### Deployed into a Private Subnet
Only accessible from with the VNet and any peered networks
### Encrypted Data in transit
Azure SQL Server encrypts in-transit data with Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). Encryption is enforced by default.
### Encrypted Data at rest
Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.
## Observability
Massdriver gives you visibility into the health of your systems. By default, flexible servers will be created with alarms to monitor at key performance degradation or failure thresholds. You will be notified when storage, memory or CPU exceeds 90% usage.

## Trade-offs
* Data layer access using Azure AD authentication is not yet supported
* Azure SQL Database Hyperscale is not supported in this bundle
